# Case Study:How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?
## An analysis of Cyclistic bike-share.
## Scope of Work
As an environmentally friendly top-notch workout, Larsen (2013) contends that bike-sharing companies offer a cost-effective way of promoting a sustainable lifestyle in urban areas. It goes without saying that encouraging the masses to utilize bicycles in their daily errands not only promotes their health but also plays a huge part in reducing carbon emissions.
### Task Overview
In this project, I utilized R programming language to analyze bike riding data from a fictional bike-sharing company in Chicago, Illinois. Cyclistic is a bike-share program offering three product categories that include reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. The company has 5824 available bikes and 692 docking stations. The main business task is to generate revenue through increased annual subscriptions by converting casual riders to annual members. Cyclistic historical trip data is hosted on their database and contains information about rideable bike types, the start station, and the end station name with coordinates, their start and end riding time, their membership status, and the trip id. The dataset provided under this license is open-source and can be used by industry practitioners
The stakeholders include: **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels. **Cyclistic marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.**Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
### Data Sources
Cyclistic’s historical trip data of the [last 12 months] (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data is available in .csv format and containts dates and times, with no outliers and relevant to the project. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under [this license] (https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.
### Project activities
    1. A clear statement of the business task
    2. A description of all data sources used
    3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
    4. A summary of your analysis
    5. Supporting visualizations and key findings

### Repository
The codebase contains three main files:
    • An R file containing data analysis and visualizations (with related comments),accessed [here]
    • An [R Markdown] file containing the case study project activities step by step with code chunks.
    • A HTML file rendering the contents in the RMarkdown file.
    • The detailed [Tableau] vizualization
    
### Conclusions and Recommendations
#### Conclusions
    • The average trips were more by annual members
    • Despite a fairly constant average ride length by subscribed members, casual riders rode for more durations than the most common ride duration.
    • Most casual riders opt for weekend use while subscribed members prefer Fridays and Wednesdays.
    • *Classic bike* is the most preferred bike, followed by electric bike.
    • *Casual riders prefer to ride on Weekends and around 5 PM in the evening*.
    • *The influx of casual riders is more in third quarter, which implies that most of the casual riders could be tourists/visitors*
    • *The most popular station have more than twice the rides started from it as compared to the second most popular one*
#### Recommendations
    • The marketing team should target casual riders over the weekend during the summer and autumn seasons.
    • Approach casual riders at Streeter Dr and Grand Avenue as a start station and Clark St & Elm St as the end station
    • Aim to stock more docked bikes and perhaps promote classic bikes to the new cohort since casual riders ride for longer durations.
    • Include a public health promotion campaign for bike riding benefits.
    • *The best time to launch the new marketing campaign are between 15:00 to 19:00, Weekends and Holidays, in the month of June to September*.
    • *A targeted strategy at most popular station will reach the maximum number of Casual riders*

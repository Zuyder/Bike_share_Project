# Bike_share_Project
Navigating-Speedy-Success
As an environmentally friendly top-notch workout, Larsen (2013) contends that bike-sharing companies offer a cost-effective way of promoting a sustainable lifestyle in urban areas. It goes without saying that encouraging the masses to utilize bicycles in their daily errands not only promotes their health but also plays a huge part in reducing carbon emissions.
Overview
In this project, I utilized R programming language to analyze bike riding data from a fictional bike-sharing company in Chicago, Illinois. Cyclistic is a bike-share program offering three product categories that include reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. The company has 5824 available bikes and 692 docking stations. The main business task is to generate revenue through increased annual subscriptions by converting casual riders to annual members. Cyclistic historical trip data is hosted on their database and contains information about rideable bike types, the start station, and the end station name with coordinates, their start and end riding time, their membership status, and the trip id. The dataset provided under this license is open-source and can be used by industry practitioners
